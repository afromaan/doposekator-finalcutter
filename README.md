# 🚜 FinalCutter ✂

DIY Remote Controlled Lawn Mower

@afromaan and @Kotux-SPS´s project

## Overview
FinalCutter is a DIY RC lawn mower with skid steering and welded frame. Our plan is to make fully functional, open-source and not too expensive and hard to make at home RC mower.

Our **first goal** is to make it work, at least. So it can drive, cut and somehow work for us.

And the **second goal** is to customizate it to its best configuration possible (still with our plans on mind). 

<br>  

<strong>That means:</strong>
1) Air Suspension 
2) Controlling Via Camera From Our Living Room
3) Autonomous Mode (with nVidia its maybe early future for us too?)

## Features
- Gasoline engine for cutting and charging
- 4 wheel drive motors
- FlySky remote control
- Raspberry Pi - motors controller
- Battery charged via alternator

## Hardware
- 👨‍🏭 Frame: DIY welded steel frame 
- ⚙️ Engine: from some old Husqvarna mower
- ⚙️ Drive motors: 4x MY1016Z 12V 250W 
- 👨‍🏭 Gas Tank: DIY welded steel gas tank (capacity 5-10l)
- 👨‍🏭 Wheels: DIY welded steel wheels (modified for mud with small spikes for better grid)
- ⚡ Alternator: some old car functional alternator
- ⚡ Battery: VARTA SILVER Dynamic 54Ah, 12V, C30 
- ⚡ Electronics between battery and alternator: VEVOR SDC-20A
- 💻 Main controller: Raspberry Pi 4B 4GB
- 💻 Remote controller: Flysky T6 (?)

# Work status
🚧 **Work in progress** 🚧


## ⚙️ <strong> Update 10/31/2025 </strong>
In september we have started **renovating the old Briggs & Stratton engine**. At first it started and kept running, on second start it unfortunately died, so we **3D modeled and printed new pipe** (carburetor to engine pipe). It fitted well but because of one **old fragment that felt** inside the combustion chamber - we didn´t know about it - and so the **engine was declared dead**.

After some rest @Kotux-SPS **brought "new" old engine to our garage**. It´s now resting here and waiting for us to finish the frame and electronics, after that **we can mount it onto the FinalCutter body**. 

### What next?
Finding best option for electric motors.


## 💻 <strong> Update 12/14/2025 </strong>
Now we are working on both the **3D model of frame** and the **code for RPI 4B**. 

Because we want it to take up to **45° slope**, we´re making sure **every component will sit well** and we have also been **stress testing** each one so it won´t break quickly.

### What next?
Now we´re gonna lock in for designing working frame.


## 💻 <strong> Update 12/18/2025 </strong>
You can now check renders of our "almost" finished **3D model** in files above.

### What next?
Gonna finish the model and start with welding.
