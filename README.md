## ⚙️ <strong> Update 10/31/2025 </strong>
In september we have started renovating the old Briggs & Stratton engine. At first it started and kept running, on second start it unfortunately died, so we 3D modeled and printed new pipe (carburetor to engine pipe). It fitted well but because of one old fragment that felt inside the combustion chamber - we didn´t know about it - and so the engine was declared dead.

After some rest @Kotux-SPS brought "new" old engine to our garage. It´s now resting here and waiting for us to finish the frame and electronics, after that we can mount it onto the FinalCutter body. 

### What next?
Finding best option for electric motors.


## 💻 <strong> Update 12/14/2025 </strong>
Now we are working on both the 3D model of frame and the code for RPI 4B. 

Because we want it to take up to 45° slope, we´re making sure every component will sit well and we are also stress testing each one so it won´t break quickly.

### What next?
Now we´re gonna lock in for designing working frame.


## 💻 <strong> Update 12/18/2025 </strong>
You can now check renders of our "almost" finished 3D model in files above.

### What next?
Gonna finish the model and start with welding.
